Premiered Mar 25, 2022The hosts on Global Enlightenment Radio Network are requested to showcase the other hosts on the network from time to time. Rev. Ed Brodrick REQUESTED to be on my show. Towards the last third, my producer Darrell added Angel Lori and Cowboy Bob, who are also hosts on the network. Darrell did this to embarrass me.

We started off talking about my past in Christianity and why I left. And Darrell asked some questions about UFO interactions--and then Lori and Bob got angry with me for stating that humans are hard wired to worship Anunnaki/angelics. The last bit is them screaming at me.

So now you know why I don't open my show to phone calls or other hosts, and why I get triggered by your religious views.
