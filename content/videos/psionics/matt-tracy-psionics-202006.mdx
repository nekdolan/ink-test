Matt Tracy and I chat about the various psionic skills we used in space and how we have used them on earth. Some of his came from his Warrior caste adoptive father Jur teaching him to use the abilities that came from his additional DNA, and some from psionics training. I shared about mine and the firewall on mine, and how some things [like teleportation] feel almost within reach. We are both Navigators in Nacht Waffen and have similar skillsets, so it's almost talking shop.

Matt is on FB and MeWe.
