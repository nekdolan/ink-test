Premiered Aug 2, 2021Walter Bosley wrote "The Empire Of The Wheel" book trilogy about 7 murders in San Bernardino, CA in 1915--and the trail of espionage and occult that swirled around them all. And he noted a 'person of interest' that drew his attention to the Sonora Aero Club and the Great Airship Mystery--and NYMZA the secret German group that funded them. The basic facts of the case are VERY 3D real.
The engines for the Aeros and Airships were what drew me into his mystery here. So, Walter Bosley and I spent nearly 2 hours discussing the anti-grav engines that obviously flowed from SAC to the Nazi die Glocke device--and the esoteric and occult story that accompanied both them and the murders in Berdu. And the discussion didn't include any ETs [aw, shucks] but stayed firmly in 3D reality with some talk of religious groups. [No, we were not promoting any.]
