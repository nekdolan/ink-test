Ian Starchild is the webmaster on my website. He is an EMT who progressed to become a Physician’s Assistant and worked with the military on the base near his home—which shanghaied him into service in the SSP as a physician in at least 3 factions: Solar Warden, Kruger Mercenaries and Nacht Waffen. That last one has been a bit tricky since he’s a Lyran starseed.

Ian did directed meditation teachings on “grounding” and “pushing away negativity”. This is a combined teaching for Energy Defense.

When he wanted to address the issues of infighting in our community, I was triggered because I’ve been witness to some of the most unethical behavior in the community in the past week and have been personally attacked by non-experiencers. I will never support what I see as unethical behavior in positions of leadership in this or any other community. I apologize for some of the tones I took, but I stand behind what I said. So this is transparency that I am not always ‘nice’, that I did not edit it out. Ian was unaware of the particular incidents that had gone on and when I showed him evidence, he was as mortified as I was.
