Robert Stanley wanted to talk about The Shining Ones--which is a spiritual approach to the Anunnaki rather than a physical one. We also discussed the UFO sightings in Washington, DC this century, which he has written a book on. And Darrell/Odin [my Producer] joined the conversation and there is some application to politics today.
