Dr. Paul Cottrell was another host on GERN and did a political show with my friend Leo Lyon Zagami. GERN owner and my producer had a policy of 'cross-pollinating', so I had him on. He kept talking about 'forbidden topics' so I could never upload it to YT.

Dr. Cottrell is a PhD and was in his residency as a medical doctor at the time of the interview. He is brilliant. I don't agree with him on everything and asked some pointed questions.

He has written some books, you can find them on Amazon.https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B07DSPV44D/about

He is on X as @dr_cottrell.
