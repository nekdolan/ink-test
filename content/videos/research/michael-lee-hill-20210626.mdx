Michael Lee Hill and I took a stroll through his music, his beliefs about Anunnaki, his interactions with Native Americans [his birth mother was Seneca] and his blood anomaly. We talked about Pythagorean Music scales, and how important those frequencies are to the LERM process. There was mention of both AR Bordon and the Labyrinth Group, who Michael worked with from 2008 until Bordon's death. We talked about 7 point star crop circles, and about his cymatic pattern of 432 Hz as A on his guitar has been proven to reactivate water.

Bio:Michael Lee Hill is an award winning musician, filmographer and UFO experiencer. His footage of the Lake Erie UFO’s has created a Billy Meier like buzz and Michael seems to have developed an intuitive relationship with these craft. In his home state of Ohio, Michael has been cataloging video after video of UFO’s over Lake Erie. The phenomena consists almost entirely of "Pulsating orb’s of light”—unusual lights seen changing colors, converging, and separating over the lake. Stories of the unexplained phenomena date back over 150 years to the indigenous North American Indian Tribes.
