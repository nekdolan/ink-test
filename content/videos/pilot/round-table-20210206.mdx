We had a roundtable for 2 hours. Yes I was included, if that bothers you, don't watch. We ALL had alters shifting and had obvious times that we blanked out. Pay attention because that denotes an alter that doesn't share memory just popped out. [That is evidence of a REAL SSP veteran.]

Amaria Sweet, Frank Emmart and Susan Long served together in several factions on Earth, Mars, the Solar System and Deep Space. Our services overlapped but they only remember me as their shuttle pilot from LOC to Mars. We started off baudy and went deeply personal and emotional. Crying. Triggers.

I edited out the break music because of copyright issues.

[Susan and Frank are no longer together at the time of reposting.]
