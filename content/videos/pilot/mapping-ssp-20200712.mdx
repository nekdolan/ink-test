Eric J Hecker invited Lou and I to spend some time at his place in Alaska in July 2020. On 12 July, 2020 we were at the ATOM Center in Anchorage and I gave my presentation Mapping the Secret Space Program with additions by Eric. Eric's lady Holly did the recording.
Mapping the Secret Space Program covers an overview of the entire topic, who does what, where and with whom and also who doesn't like who else. It covers Earth level spy agencies, militaries, corporations and conglomerates as well as the shifting ET alliances each is known to have.
So when a whistleblower comes up with they served with Kruger--you will know who that is. And that if they served with Nacht Waffen, that means they don't like Planetary Corporations. At all. Ever. And you will understand which side of the various wars that person was on and be able to categorize their testimony accordingly. Why does that matter?
WWII had Germans invading Poland. It had Americans invading France. It had Japanese invading Guam. Americans invading Guadalcanal. All in the same war, doing similar things in very different ways. And each set of veterans will have very different opinions of what happened.
This is one of the presentations I give at conferences. Enjoy!
