This was the Question and Answer period after the presentation at the ATOM Center in Anchorage, AK on 12 July 2020. The entire session was longer, the recordings were in 15 minute increments and we stitched them together. So you may not get full answers. This was the best we could do.

Eric Hecker was an awesome co-presenter and I was glad to have him aboard.
