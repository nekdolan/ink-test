In Part 4, we started with Majestic 12 and as usual discussed other things, including Jack Parson, ancient religions, consent, Galactic Justice and the Last American Outlaw [who Eric knew]. I responded to some of the people who have been sending me outrageously intrusive messages.

Eric Hecker is a researcher and experiencer born on Long Island in New York. He was targeted at a young age for the STARGATE program presumably because he scored very highly on the standardized testing at the time. He has very clear memories of his Monroe Institute training. He later joined the Navy and was selected for the Submarine Service. This was the first time he crossed paths with Raytheon. After a very brief "training period" in the Sub Service, Eric became a Plumber working at some of the most exclusive, odd, and remote places on the planet. He even spent an entire year at the South Pole Station.

Now Eric lives in Alaska where he has continued to work in an array of remote sites. He is also working in the community to try and help folks make connections with their own past as well as his own. You can follow his work on both YouTube and MeWe at DecipheringMyExperience.

***My rant at the beginning was because a couple of members of the public contacted me to inform me that they believed we were in telepathic love affairs. That I had absolutely no knowledge of. At the very best, they are delusional. At worst, they are acting out sexual fantasies that could lead them to violence towards me in the future. I wanted to make sure no one else thought they were doing this. If you think you are in a telepathic relationship with anyone you watch on Youtube or television, you need professional help. Please get it.***
