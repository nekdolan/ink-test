In this interview Penny is giving a fascinating account about her service in Marsische Heimschild - the German militia on Mars - as a member of an all-female pilot unit called the Valkyries. The interview goes into a number of different topics:
- What kind of technological enhancements did the pilots have?
- What capabilities and weapons were the battle craft equipped with?
- What were Penny's duties and some of the incidents that happened during service?
- Which local Martian races did Penny encounter?
- How did the Martian environment affect the flying missions?
And many more!
