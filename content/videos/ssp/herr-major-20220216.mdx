Herr Major came back to talk about the civilians in the German space colonies, their culture, their differences from Americans and Australians, how they view religion. [This is told from their point of view, so comments about them being Nazis will be deleted and reported as they are not.]

Herr Major works in law enforcement and cannot be public, but wanted to share the memories he has of serving with Penny Bradley for 15 years. We did Intelligence gathering for Nacht Waffen by posing as smugglers in the region of space with Bund Freuer Deutscher Welten colonies and outposts.

That particular alter of Penny's started off in Kruger Mercenary faction as a fighter pilot and sensor array mechanic and transferred to Herr Major's ship 5 years into her 20-and-back for that alter.NOTE: Herr Major remembers this time VERY differently than I do and slides into disrespect often.
