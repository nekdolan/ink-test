In Part 2, we talked about various CIA projects related to Remote Viewing.

Eric Hecker is a researcher and experiencer born on Long Island in New York. He was targeted at a young age for the STARGATE program presumably because he scored very highly on the standardized testing at the time. He has very clear memories of his Monroe Institute training. He later joined the Navy and was selected for the Submarine Service. This was the first time he crossed paths with Raytheon. After a very brief "training period" in the Sub Service, Eric became a Plumber working at some of the most exclusive, odd, and remote places on the planet. He even spent an entire year at the South Pole Station.

Now Eric lives in Alaska where he has continued to work in an array of remote sites. He is also working in the community to try and help folks make connections with their own past as well as his own. You can follow his work on both YouTube and Facebook at DecipheringMyExperience.

I want to state that my partner Lou and I spent a week at Eric's house with him and his lady. I saw his DD214. I saw his paystubs for the Navy and Raytheon. I saw his paystubs for the plumbing company. I saw his report card for the private school on Long Island. I saw a box of photographs for all of it--especially Eric and Holly at South Pole Station. He was REALLY there and REALLY saw those things.
