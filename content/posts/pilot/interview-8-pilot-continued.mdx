PILOT SERVICE CONTINUED, MISSIONS TO OTHER COLONIES AND THE TRANSFER TO NACHT WAFFEN.

In this interview we go deeper into Penny's experiences as a fighter pilot in Marsische Heimschild - the German militia on Mars, interacting with various Mars races and gathering intelligence. She also talks about the interpersonal relations within the colony as well as the day-to-day interactions between the Draco and the German staff in Aries Prima.

The conversation expands into Penny's missions to other colonies in a different alter. She describes visiting New Berlin - the capital of the German Das Bundes on Mars.

Finally, Penny talks about the dramatic episode that led to her being transferred onto a military freighter ship in Nacht Waffen on which she worked as a navigator for 25 years up until the end of her service in 2014.
