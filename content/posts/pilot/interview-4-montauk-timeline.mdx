In this interview Penny describes the six-month "side trip" to the Montauk base (in Long Island, New York) where she and other children were made to perform time travel and interdimensional missions using a wormhole activation device known as the "Montauk chair" allegedly taken from an alien spacecraft.

However, it is not the astonishing technologies and the missions that were the focus of these children's day-to-day experiences, but the cruelty, the torture and the openly sadistic behavior on the part of the people running these programs.

Penny depicts a reality that would be unthinkable for most "normals", especially in the West, where most people think that terrorism is the scariest thing out there.

Here are some other questions that we touched upon during this interview:

- What were some of the goals of the original Montauk Program?

- Which genetics children was the program targeting and which ET genetics do different human blood types point to?

- Who are some the elites running these programs what is their genetic lineage?

- Are our Solar system and planet really "Draco free" as some of the witnesses have claimed?

And many more!
