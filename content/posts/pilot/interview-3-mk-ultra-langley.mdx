PENNY BRADLEY (interview 3) - SURVIVING MK-ULTRA MIND FRACTURE AT LANGLEY (49 min.)

- What is trauma-based MK-Ultra mind fracture and why was it being done to little children?

- What are the purposes of this process?

- Where did some of these "methods" come from?

- What kind of psychic and combat training did the children go through and who taught them?

- Were extraterrestrials involved in these programs?

You will hear about all of this and more as Penny gives her first-hand account of how she survived through the MK-Ultra and Military Abduction (MILAB) programs that were performed at Langley, Virginia where she was kept by the CIA from 1959 to 1964.
