Ian Starchild is the webmaster on my website. This is another 'stage name' to protect his privacy while he comes forward.

He is an EMT who progressed to become a Physician’s Assistant and worked with the military on the base near his home—which shanghaied him into service in the SSP as a physician in at least 3 factions: Solar Warden, Kruger Mercenaries and Nacht Waffen. That last one has been a bit tricky since he’s a Lyran starseed. [And he has a personal hatred of Tall Whites from his own interactions with them.]
