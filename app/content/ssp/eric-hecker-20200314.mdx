Eric Hecker was the plumber at the Raytheon base in Antarctica [I've seen his Congressional Medal for this]. We started off with him talking about Antarctica and then drifted into SSP and the 'dreams' he isn't sure are not memories--and a lot of other things.
We had some serious interference in this recording session. A LOT of what I said was not recorded at all. I hope the conversation is still understandable.
