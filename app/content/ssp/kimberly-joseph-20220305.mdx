I'm doing a story arc of interviewing survivors of the Montauk 2 program that was verified by Preston Nichols as having existed. Regardless of the rumors, there were girls and women at Montauk too.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fdc9cPRlcEw
I asked Kimberly to come on because she is the woman that Joseph Powell testifies to being trauma bonded with. We decided to include Joseph in the discussion. [I tried to just give explanations for terms used, but I'm still officially on medical LOA and I admit I had trouble.] So it's a real discussion with 3 people who have survived Montauk at different stages of it's programs. It isn't age restricted because we avoided the details of mind fracture procedures.
Kimberly was put in the super soldier and secret space program around 7 years old. Both of her grandfathers were involved in the Manhattan project and flew experimental aircraft during WWII. Kimberly has mostly German ancestry. She is a Milab hybrid, O positive with 10 percent alien DNA. She awakened to her nearly full memories in 2020, with over 20 alters in Nachtwaffen, Solar Warden, Krueger, Mars Defence Force, Planetary Corporations, and Black Shield. Her alter Jessica remembers being used as a time soldier in the Montauk program and hooked to an advanced AI system. She comes forward to Awaken and heal other SSP and unite them against a common enemy, the military industrial complex milab program and the child trafficking ACIO. She found her twin Joseph to help fight evil and bring the bad guys to justice and to soon free humanity from slavery and dark ET agendas.
Kimberly has not yet made an online presence as a whistleblower--I will add contact info when she informs me.
Joseph W. Powell is an Empath who was inducted into an MK ultra program in 1997-1998 at the age of eight while attending The Desert Adventist Academy. He served in Solar Warden, The Ashtar Galactic Command & Nacht Waffen.
