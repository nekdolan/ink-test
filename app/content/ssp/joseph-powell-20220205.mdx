Premiered Feb 5, 2022For my first podcast post-op [I had cervical spinal fusion on Dec 5, 2021, I had Joseph Powell step up to talk about his time at both Antarctica and Montauk, the issues of "twinning"--or creating an artificial Twin Flame through trauma bonding. The reality of sex used for both punishment and reward at Montauk. This very much has the feel of a counseling session rather than an expose.
I started off with a short rant about several topics.
I am still not released post-op by my doctor. Joseph was getting over a cold. We talked like friends who have been through similar hells.
Joseph W. Powell is an Empath who was inducted into an MK ultra program in 1997-1998 at the age of eight while attending The Desert Adventist Academy. He served in Solar Warden, The Ashtar Galactic Command & Nacht Waffen.
Joseph is available on FB. His group there is:/ 226672939647830
