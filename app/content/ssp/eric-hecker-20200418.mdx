Eric Hecker has been researching the Stargate Project collection of programs through the CIA declassified website and wanted my input on questions he had about both that and about some out of the ordinary childhood experiences of his own.
We talked about Penny's mind fracture program at Langley, about black goo and it's effects, about the need for people to be able to be honest about their experiences in the programs in order to heal. And more about Camp Hero.
We also discussed Penny's Zha.a.mi abduction and rescue by Nacht Waffen in June 2018.Atp = adenosine triphosphate
The actor my father resembled, David Jansen, starred in the tv series The Fugitive back in black and white days.
