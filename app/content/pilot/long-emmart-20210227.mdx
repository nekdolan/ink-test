Susan Long and Frank Emmart, also known as Dragon and Phoenix, came back to talk more in depth about their service. [My alters got in the way again--but they still talked.] They shared about being part of the Sonora Aero Club in the 1860s, about raiding planets for ancient tech and libraries, about battles with other humans and ETs. They shared about being Lichtsoldaten in Nacht Waffen and what is different about them to be that. They shared how cool it is to be with their fighting buddy after all this time--and how cool it is to share the memories telepathically between them. [It almost makes up for what they remember.]
NOTE: AT THE TIME OF THIS RE-UPLOAD, SUSAN AND FRANK ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER.
