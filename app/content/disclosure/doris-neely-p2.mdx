description:
---
Doris C. Neely is a retired CIA data entry clerk who spent her career entering people's "packets" into the memory banks of the CIA computer system and working in their Archive of the original documents.
In this episode, she talks about how she came to work for the Agency, and an overview of what she did there in general terms. We got sidetracked into a discussion of several interactions with either angelic beings or UFOs--that both she and her son, my producer, had experienced 20 or so years apart. She talked about her lawsuit against the Agency over racial discrimination and her firing afterwards.
Doris is my producer's mother. Darrell Odin Neely took part in the conversation, especially when she brought up the 'visitations'.
She kept the mic where we can hear her better this time. I'm hoping for a part 3 . . . . [Reminder, this is not a studio production, it is 3 people at corners of a phone line.]
