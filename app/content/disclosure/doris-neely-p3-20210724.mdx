Premiered Jul 24, 2021Doris C. Neely is a retired CIA data entry clerk who spent her career entering people's "packets" into the memory banks of the CIA computer system and working in their Archive of the original documents.
In this episode, we had agreed on a format where I talked about what I remembered and she said if it had been in my file or not. [We did this so she is not violating her Secrecy Oath that still has 10 years or so on it.] She verified most of it, told me a couple of things I had wrong and mentioned things I had not remembered.
And we talked about how difficult it is to be trying to do the work for 32 alters and remembering details of lives that were not actually mine but the memories are now. That I had enough recall before the memory activation that I had no doubt the memories were real. And how difficult it is for her that her friend [my alter] who was killed in an Iran-Contra plane crash in Nicaragua is still alive and talking to her.
