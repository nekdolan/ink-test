Matt Tracy starts telling us about the science used by his alters in Nacht Waffen, the background to another session on the engines [still to come]. He has an alter who designs engines for various ships, and he's remembering how it's done.
This episode was pre-recorded because I had a medical procedure on Jan 15th.
