Matt Tracy served in Nacht Waffen with me, and he also had an alter who was in Engineering. His engineer alter designed engines and power plants for ships. He also had an alter who was adopted by a Draco who trained him in Draco spirituality and martial arts. We mostly talked engines, the physics of hyperspace--but we chased a lot of rabbits too.
Matt Tracy is on FB and MeWe.
