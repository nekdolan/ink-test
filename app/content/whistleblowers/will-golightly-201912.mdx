---
Will Glover and I have alters who work on the same Nacht Waffen ship. We also have alters who work for different factions in the secret space black ops, doing different things. We talked about the factions, and how to tell which faction by the technology used. We talked about bleedover experiences with alters, and coming back physically injured.[This version corrects the echo in the first one.]
